## Who I am

I’m Rômulo Garofalo, I'm a backend developer (I know frontend too, but mainly backend). I'm almost finishing my college in System Analysis and Development at FATEC Rubens Lara. Functional programming with Haskell has been my hobby in these last two years.

## What I know

About the technologies that I've worked with and made some projects with

### [](#header-4)Frameworks and programming languages

*   Python (Django)
*   C# (Windows Forms and Web Forms)
*   PHP (Laravel)
*   Java (Play Framework)
*   Haskell (Yesod) <- this one's what I like the most

### [](#header-4) Experience

* PHP - I've worked with PHP and Laravel, developing new features and fixing bugs for a system that focuses on the auditing of invoices, one of the features was taking a code from the invoices using OCR or Regex(in case of pdfs w/ text) and using it to make a Curl and get informations from a website to be shown on the system.
